        <p>The Totem archive derives its inspiration from ancient ritualistic objects and totems and their significance. It ponders on the intricate relationship individuals have with inanimate objects. It juxtaposes ancient totems of spiritual significance with the modern day objects and studies the rituals associated with them. </p>

       <p>The next step was to find a way of ritaulistic method of accesing the collection and the archive. It was important to make the archival space resonate with the content it housed. The archive, thus, tries to play on an underlying mystical theme, lets one find their way, and guides them through subtle responses.</p>

        <p>At this point, the archive needed a design, a logo or a visual queue that was representative of the underlying theme. For this purpose, I studied ancient totem poles, their meaning and the way they were created.</p>

        <p>The ancient totem poles carvings included animals stacked one on top of another and were considered supernatural beings who could transform into one another. A similar totem pole was created for the archive that contained the objects of the archive.</p>
